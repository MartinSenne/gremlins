/**
 * Abstraction of the concept of action and associated support.
 *
 * <p>Actionables can be invoked to do something: method calls, scripts, functions, commands, URLs etc...
 * 
 * <p>
 * A successful platform needs to ease definitoin of actions, re-definition and injection of actions
 * etc.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Here, we're taking this to extreme.
 * 
 * ActionItem is the basic action concept. We're extending it as a FunctionConcept - accepts input and output.
