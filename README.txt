What's this?
------------
Razie's playground for workflows, asynchronous stuff and generic actionables.


Why?
----
Threads, shared state, actors, processes...they're all stepping stones. A framework that allows full expressivity for creating asynchronous/parallel and distributed work units are what we need.

The three ingredients are: flexibility, expressivity and low cost.

Cost to create a workflow must be low. That implies graphical representations, DSL etc. Cost to run this framework must be low. Cost to re-configure, debug and operate must be low.

The framework must allow users to express any construct they can think of and support it.

Flexibility is a trait embedded in the scala language. The framework must be flexible so new patterns, constructs and whatnot be allowed.


Details
-------
The code is generally self-documented. Keep your eyes out for package.html and similar stuff.

This is an investigation of the concept, so far.


Roadmap
-------
I will only maintain this as I need to. If there's some large user community developing (doubt that, really), 
we'll see - I could co-op some volunteers.

I will add more code as I need it/write it for all kinds of reasons.
